# TileMaker #

TileMaker will allow the user to select images they wish to use as terrain tiles. For each tile the user will define the type/category of each of the sides. Tiles that can be placed adjacent to one another will have adjoining sides of the same type/category.

The output of TileMaker is tileset.xml (described in Data\_Storage)
