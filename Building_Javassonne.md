# Building Javassonne #

  * Download the source, and open in Eclipse
  * Left click on the project, and choose export
  * Export a runnable jar, using a Run Configuration that is using the earliest possible java runtime

Javassonne can be built with JRE 1.5 as of time of this writing, and Mac does not yet have a JRE 1.6, so please build with 1.5
